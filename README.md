### Killer Queen
This is my take on the Cuenca programming challenge

#### Installation

1. Ensure you have python 3.7 installed

2. Setup your virtual environment and the project's dependencies using `make`

    ```
    $ make
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment

    ```
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Run it!

    ```
    $ python -m killer_queen
    ```

#### Testing

Testing is handled by pytest, to run the tests:

```
$ pytest
```
